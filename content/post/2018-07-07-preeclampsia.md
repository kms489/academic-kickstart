  Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious and potentially fatal disease for pregnant women and their fetus. Currently, diagnosis is based on newly onset hypertension and the presence of protein in the urine. However, these diagnostic criteria are lacking. Diabetomics Inc. (www.diabetomics.com) has produced a rapid point-of-care test (Lumella) for the identification of a novel preeclampsia biomarker (Rasanen et al. 2015, AJOG). 
   This is a large project with study sites around the world: India, Switerland, Finland, Canada, and more. The work that I do with this company involves statistical analyses on the bleeding edge of science. The current "gold standard" is faulty and leads to high misclassification of healthy mothers and those with PE. It is my responsibility to use classifcation and prediction methods to accurately idenitfy mothers who are at high risk for developing PE within 4 weeks.
